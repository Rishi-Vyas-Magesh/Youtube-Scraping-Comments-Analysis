# Youtube-Scraping-Comments-Analysis

We know Youtube is a video streaming service platform, Which generates a lot of textual content in terms of comments. These are invalueable in figuring out what the target audience of these digital products feel and think about them.
This project I undertook, covers Sentiment Analysis, Word Cloud,most frequently used words, Positive and negative Sentiment words, Topic Modelling, Named Entity Recognition,, Count of Emotion words and much more Data processing and Handling which is clearly seen in my code.
I have scraped the Youtube comments for "Oppenheimer","Dunkirk", "Interstellar" trailers using SELENIUM + Chrome Driver and the code I devoloped perfected with AI. For, "The Dark Knight Rises" Trailer I used "Youtube Comments Suite" from LinkedIN(Developed by a induvidual). Its a software whcih scrapes comments easily with the URL but there are some data quality drawbacks.

I have attached the IPYNB files. Please have a look.
